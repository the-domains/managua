# Monumental Managua 

This paper is the product of a one-month study conducted in Managua, Nicaragua from November to December 2013 as part of an international study abroad semester directed by the School for International Training. The primary objective of this study is to analyze the State administration and citizen perception of monuments located at four sites throughout the city of Managua--the Peace Park, the park of ALBA/Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal, the monument to Hugo Chávez at Plaza Inter and the monument to former mayor Alexis Argüello at the Plaza de la Victoria -- all erected during the most recent and continuing presidency of Daniel Ortega, 2007-2013\.  Through this analysis the study seeks to answer the question what does the history and current treatment of Managua's monuments reflect about Nicaraguan political history and the goals for the current administration?

As the capitol of Nicaragua, Managua represents the nation's political stage, the "center that represents the nation for citizen's living in the city and in the country" Thus the physical landscape of Managua is the government's loudspeaker, and consequently bears the scars of changing political regimes and the majority of contemporary national monuments.
