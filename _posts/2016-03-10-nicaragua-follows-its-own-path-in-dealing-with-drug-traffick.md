description: "Back in the day, the city of Bluefields inspired poets. In truth, it should be paradise, because it sits in an enviable position along Nicaragua's Caribbean coast. But as history unfolded, Bluefields became a forgotten city, cut off from the rest of the country by a vast jungle and different culture."
